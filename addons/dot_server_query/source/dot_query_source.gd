## Builds the snapshot both query protocols answer from, and caches it.
##
## Registered as [code]dot_query_source[/code] in [DotRegistry], so a game can find
## it and add a [DotQueryProvider] without being handed a reference.
##
## [b]The cache is a security control, not an optimisation.[/b] Gathering a snapshot
## walks every session and every cvar. Doing that per packet means a querier can
## make the server do real work by sending small packets, which is the cheapest
## denial of service there is — and unlike a flood of game traffic it does not even
## need a connection. Rebuilding at most once per
## [member DotServerConfig.query_cache_sec] puts a ceiling on it: a thousand queries
## a second cost one rebuild and a thousand serialisations of an already-built
## dictionary.
##
## Nothing here opens a socket. [DotQueryServer] and [DotA2SServer] do that, and
## either, both or neither may be running.

## course claim any app it likes; nothing downstream is allowed to treat this as
